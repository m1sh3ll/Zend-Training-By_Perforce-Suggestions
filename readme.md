Changes suggested for the Zend Courseware VM. 

PHP-III (Advanced PHP) is a course taught by long time Packt author and PHP Programmer Doug Bierer. The VM is included in the courseware but does not include any styling or even a home page when accessing the localhost page. The vm is established with vagrantfile for use with Virtual Box.
